# real-estate-ai-agent

The goal of this project is to make the property search process more engaging, convenient and tailored to individual preferences. Key components are listed below:
1. Generated real estate listing with texts and images. Texts will be generated by using ChatGPT model and images will be generated by using Stability AI's Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) (text to images generation).
2. Stored generated property info in chromadb and leveraged CLIP Embeddings in LangChain to map both modalities to the same embedding space so we can compare them semantically.
3. The agent will list out top K most recommended properties based on users' preferences and generate more personalized descriptions of the recommended properties to attract users' attention. The descriptions will be unique and tailored to the preferences provided by users 

Some notes: 
This real estate AI agent will use a chatGPT 3.5 model as foundation model and langchain for content generation, and chromadb as a vector database for semantic search to provide personalized real estate listings. It also includes gradio for a simple UI setup.
Results and outputs including generated text and images are displayed in the jupyter notebook
